# wiki-page-web-scraping
- I have scraped data from a table in a wikipedia page website.
- The rows and columns of the table and the data inside the table were also scarped.
- I have used libraries like __BeautifulSoup__ and **Pandas** to scrap the data.
- The extracted data was converted into a csv file.
